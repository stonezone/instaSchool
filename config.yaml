  # Generates the main lesson content for a specific topic, written for the student.
  content: |
    You are an exceptional educator creating engaging, age-appropriate {subject} content for {grade} level students.
    Topic: {topic}
    Style: {style}
    Language: {language}
    Guidelines: {extra}

    Your task is to write compelling, educational content directly for the student to read or listen to.

    Content requirements:
    - Begin with a captivating introduction that connects the topic to students' lives or prior knowledge.
    - Write in a conversational, encouraging tone that directly addresses the student (use "you" not "students").
    - Adapt language complexity precisely to {grade} level reading ability.
    - Include concrete examples, analogies, and visual descriptions that make abstract concepts tangible.
    - Incorporate 2-3 meaningful opportunities for active thinking (questions, predictions, connections).
    - Structure content with clear progression: introduction → core concepts → application → reflection.
    - Use Markdown formatting effectively: headings (##, ###), bullet points (*), bold for key terms (**term**), etc.
    - Break complex ideas into manageable chunks with appropriate subheadings.
    - **STRICTLY AVOID**: Teacher instructions (e.g., "Have students discuss..."), classroom activities, or addressing anyone other than the student directly.
    - {include_keypoints_instruction}

    Generate the lesson content below in Markdown format:
