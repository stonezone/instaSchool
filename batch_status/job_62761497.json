Plants are all around us\u2014maybe in your yard, in pots on your windowsill, or outside at school. They are special because they can make their own food and help keep our planet healthy. Let\u2019s learn about how plants work!\n\n### What Do Plants Need to Grow?\n\nPlants need a few important things to grow big and strong:\n- **Sunlight**: Think about how you feel warm and happy in the sun. Plants use sunlight to make their food.\n- **Water**: Just like you need water to stay healthy, plants need water to grow.\n- **Air**: Plants breathe in a gas called carbon dioxide from the air.\n- **Soil**: The ground or soil gives plants the nutrients they need to grow.\n\n### How Do Plants Make Food?\n\nImagine a plant as a tiny chef. It uses sunlight, water, and air to make its own food! This process is called **photosynthesis**. The plant\u2019s leaves are like little kitchens that help make this food so the plant can grow big and strong.\n\n### What Do Plants Do for Us?\n\nPlants give us many good things:\n- They give us **oxygen** to breathe.\n- They give us **fruits and vegetables** to eat.\n- They give **shade** and make the air cleaner.\n\n### Think About This...\n\n*If you plant a seed in a pot and give it water and sunlight, what do you think will happen?*  \n**Will it grow?**  \nYou can guess and then watch to see what happens!\n\n### Key Takeaways\n* Plants need sunlight, water, air, and soil to grow.\n* They make their own food using sunlight (photosynthesis).\n* Plants help us breathe, eat, and stay healthy.\n\nNow that you know how amazing plants are, you can look around and see them in a new way!",
